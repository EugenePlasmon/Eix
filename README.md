# Eix

UE4-based game being developed in purpose to create soulslike mechanics.

## Combat system

There's melee combat system inspired by games from "souls" family, but also adding some new stuff. It's in active development process.

The main feature is combos (e.g. attacks combinations). Every primary (left click mouse or right bumper button) or secondary (right click mouse or right trigger button) attack can combine with the next primary or secondary attack.
Attacks can be chargeable. Chargeable attacks can also be a part of a combo, or start a combo.

Here are few examples at work:

// TODO add gifs representing combo attacks

## More things to go...

Current plan:
- Damage types with different severity impacts (for example, long heavy sword has greater severity than a short one) which will be fully data-oriented.
- Hit reactions along with stagger times (also configurable via data) and stuns.
- AI characters who will also implement the character combat behavior.
- Ranged weapons
